# ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers
ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers sort and prioritize your ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers

Windows has a strange 14-16 icon overlay limit. That is a problem when you are using multiple apps that all wants to be the dominant overlay provider. Windows only picks the 16 first entries from Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers so different programs have started adding a lot of spaces in front of the key name to ensure that they get picked first. 

This tools gives an easy access to reorder the entries.
